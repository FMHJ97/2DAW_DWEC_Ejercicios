Which One is the Most Recommended?

If you need to insert or retrieve text (and not HTML),
textContent is generally more recommended because:

    It's more performant than innerText.
    It is safe to use as it doesn't interpret the input as HTML (no XSS risks).
    It works consistently across elements, even when the content is hidden.

Use innerHTML only when you actually need to manipulate HTML structure,
but be cautious and sanitize any user input to avoid security risks.


In summary:

textContent is the safest and most recommended for simple text manipulation.

innerText is useful when you only want the visible text and are concerned
with what the user sees.

innerHTML should be used with care for more complex HTML manipulations.
